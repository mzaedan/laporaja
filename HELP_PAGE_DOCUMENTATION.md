# Help and Support Page

## Overview
The Help and Support page provides users with comprehensive guidance on how to effectively use the LapoRaja reporting system. It categorizes reports by priority levels and provides examples to help users understand which category their issue belongs to.

## Features

### 1. Priority-Based Categorization
The help page organizes reports into three priority levels:

- **High Priority (Red)**: Safety and security issues requiring immediate attention
- **Medium Priority (Yellow)**: Infrastructure and public facility issues needing timely resolution
- **Low Priority (Blue)**: Administrative and routine service issues

### 2. Detailed Examples
Each priority category includes specific, real-world examples to help users classify their reports correctly:

- **High Priority Examples**: Fallen trees blocking roads, damaged bridges, fires, electrical hazards, water pipe breaks
- **Medium Priority Examples**: Potholed roads, clogged drains, accumulated garbage, broken streetlights, leaking roofs
- **Low Priority Examples**: Delayed administrative services, data entry errors, security patrol scheduling, cleanliness issues, damaged information boards
